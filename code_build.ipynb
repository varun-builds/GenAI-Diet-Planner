Machine learning is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on algorithms that can “ learn ” the patterns of training data and, subsequently, make accurate inferences about new data. If a machine can coordinate multiple tasks, fewer humans are needed to manage them.

    "## Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are LangChain Agents?**\n",
    "- Agents use an LLM to determine which tools to call and in what order\n",
    "- They follow a reasoning loop: Think → Act → Observe → Repeat\n",
    "- Excellent for complex multi-step tasks that require decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Agents:**\n",
    "- Multi-tool workflows where tool selection depends on user input\n",
    "- Tasks requiring reasoning about tool sequencing\n",
    "- Problems where the solution path isn't predetermined\n",
    "- Interactive applications needing dynamic tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Agent Types:**\n",
    "- **ReAct Agent**: Reason + Act pattern (recommended)\n",
    "- **OpenAI Functions Agent**: For models with function-calling capabilities\n",
    "- **Conversational Agent**: For multi-turn dialogue with memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. Define clear tool descriptions - agents rely on these to decide tool usage\n",
    "2. Include input validation in tools to prevent errors\n",
    "3. Use `max_iterations` to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "4. Enable `verbose=True` during development for debugging\n",
    "5. Handle parsing errors gracefully\n",
    "6. Keep tools focused and single-purpose\n",
    "7. Provide example outputs in tool descriptions"
